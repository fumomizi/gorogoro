          <p class="prominent">In the shadowed valleys and misty peaks of Yokai Mountain, where ancient spirits dwell and mystical energies flow, lies a battleground of intellect and strategy.<br/>
          Here, the tengu, masters of the winds and keepers of secrets, challenge all who dare to a duel of <em>goro goro Shogi</em>.</p>

          <h3>🎴 The Challenge of the Tengu 🎴</h3>

          <p>Do you possess the cunning and wisdom to face the tengu in a match of <em>goro goro Shogi</em>? In this hallowed dojo, where the board is set in a sacred 5×6 grid, challengers must prove their mettle <strong>by winning more than 15 games out of 30</strong> against these mythical beings.</p>

          <p>The tengu await, their clothes rustling and eyes gleaming, ready to engage in a battle of wits and tactics. <strong>Each victory brings honor; each defeat, a lesson.</strong></p>

          <h3>🍃 Rise to the Challenge: The Path of the Goro Goro Shogi Warrior 🍃</h3>

          <p>Embrace the spirit of the mountain, hone your skills, and immerse yourself in a game that transcends the mundane. Whether you're a seasoned Shogi player or a curious wanderer stepping onto the enchanted path, the gates of Yokai Mountain are open to you.</p>

          <p>Challenge the tengu, learn their secrets, and perhaps, become one of them. The wind whispers of glory and adventure, and the game is set.</p>

          <h3>🎏 Begin Your Journey 🎏</h3>

          <p>Enter the dojo, take your place at the board, and let the games of gorogoro Shogi commence. The tengu are ready. <strong>Are you?</strong></p>

          <h3>📜 Rules 📜</h3>

          <p>A 5×6 version with 16 pieces is known as goro goro dōbutsu shōgi (ごろごろどうぶつしょうぎ), which is the same as <em>goro goro Shogi</em>. <...></p>
          <p>Promotion zones are the first and last <strong>2 ranks</strong>. It has the same restrictions on dropped pieces in shogi including two pawns <strong>(nifu)</strong> and pawn drop with immediate checkmate <strong>(uchifuzume)</strong>. Perpetual check (4 move repetition) is also a draw as in dōbutsu shōgi.</p>
